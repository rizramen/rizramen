# ðŸ‘‹Hi, I'm Fariz

I'm currently studying **International Media Informatics** at **HTW Berlin** in my 2nd semester. My focus is on combining technology with creativity â€” particularly in the areas of **frontend development**, **design**, and **user experience**.

##  Goals

I'm working toward becoming a **Frontend Developer (Werkstudent)**, and I'm currently deepening my knowledge of:

- JavaScript & React
- Responsive Web Design (HTML/CSS, Flexbox, Grid)
- UI/UX fundamentals

##  Interests

Beyond code, I have a strong connection to the creative world:

-  **Music**: I enjoy both listening and creating
-  **Fashion**: I'm interested in aesthetics and personal style
-  **Bouldering**: I love solving problems on the wall as much as in code


##  Get in Touch

Feel free to connect or collaborate on creative or technical projects.
